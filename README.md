This repository demonstrates a common error when using the CSS `calc()` function with percentages. The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version. The issue arises from the inconsistent behavior of `calc()` when handling percentages, especially in complex layouts. The solution often involves restructuring the CSS or using alternative approaches to achieve the desired layout.
