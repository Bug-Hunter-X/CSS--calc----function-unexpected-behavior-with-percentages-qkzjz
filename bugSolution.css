To solve this problem, you should avoid using percentages inside `calc()` whenever possible. Instead, use pixel values or other absolute units. For example, the following code will work as expected: 
```css
#element {
  width: calc(50% + 10px);
}
```
If you must use percentages, ensure that the percentages are relative to the parent element's width and that the calculation is performed correctly. You might need to adjust your CSS structure or use different units to ensure that the calculation is performed as expected. In some cases, you may need to use JavaScript to perform the calculation and set the width of the element dynamically.  Consider using a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less to make calculations more maintainable and readable.
